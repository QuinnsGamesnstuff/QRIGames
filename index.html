				About
			</h2>
			<p>
				This website, once completed, will feature mini-games that are free to play. Right now there are currently three games to play each will receive regular updates as well as the addition of new games. I make the games myself using <a href="https://www.construct.net/en" target ="Constructweb" style="color:black"> Construct 3 </a> which is an easy to use game making website. If you’re interested in making your own game I'd highly recommend it for beginners. Unlike many other sites, My website has versions giving you access to all previous updates so you can keep track as to what's been going on. For more information <p>Hover here <span class="extra">The system works where the first number represents any big updates, the middle three numbers represent medium updates or game updates, and the last two numbers represent updates to the page itself. when a section has reached its max value it would be added to the next section.Example:(0.000.99)-->(0.010.00)</p></span>

			<h2>
				Future Updates 
			</h2>
			
				<ul>
						Future updates:
					 
					<li>Blockz- with the release of the second content patch for Blockz, I added a new block that when hit would subtract 10 points from your score and could be activated twice for a total of -20 points. I also made the regular block have different colors depending on how many shots it takes to destroy them, the darker they are the more hits they can take.
					 <li> Game #5 - It's been a long while since I've worked on releasing a new game, but no more. I'm thinking that Game #5 is going to be a Maze game where your goal is to solve puzzles and  avoid enemies. 
					 <li>Website formatting and design improvements where necessary.
