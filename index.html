				About
			</h2>
			<p>
				This website, once completed, will feature mini-games that are free to play. Right now there are currently three games to play each will receive regular updates as well as the addition of new games. I make the games myself using <a href="https://www.construct.net/en" target ="Constructweb" style="color:black"> Construct 3 </a> which is an easy to use game making website. If you’re interested in making your own game I'd highly recommend it for beginners. Unlike many other sites, My website has versions giving you access to all previous updates so you can keep track as to what's been going on. For more information <p>Hover here <span class="extra">The system works where the first number represents any big updates, the middle three numbers represent medium updates or game updates, and the last two numbers represent updates to the page itself. when a section has reached its max value it would be added to the next section.Example:(0.000.99)-->(0.010.00)</p></span>

			<h2>
				Future Updates 
			</h2>
			<p> 
				<ul>
						Future updates to current games:
					
					<li>Galactic Wars -Asteroids, are dangerous Celestial bodies that no one's safe from. they will fly around space and when shot they fracture into two smaller asteroids that move slightly faster in random directions. Asteroids do slightly more damage compared to your bullets and can weaken enemies if you know what you doing, if you don’t you'll die.
					<li>Goul Shooter -(new level, weapons, and enemies) The first thing I want to do is add a new level or change the current one up after that is done I will turn my attention to a new weapon.  
					<li>Blockz -(Powerups)
					 <li> Development on SticksandStones progressing smoothly.
					 <li>Website formatting and design improvements where necessary.
